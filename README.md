# hello-world
This repository is for my professional preperation class.
I am from a southwest suburb of Chicago. I grew up playing volleyball my whole life and in highschool got to play at state for three of the four years I was there. I have one younger brother who goes the the University of Central FLorida. I love to do hot yoga and pilates with my friends. Over the summer I got the opportunity to work with the Savannah Bananas for a week which was such a cool experience. When I am older I want to work as a analyst for a major league sports team.
